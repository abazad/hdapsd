hdapsd 2009xxxx:
	Evgeni Golov <sargentd@die-welt.net>
	* Support for the Apple Motion Sensor.
	* Udev rules obsolete, we can find the device on our own now.

hdapsd 20090129:
	Evgeni Golov <sargentd@die-welt.net>:
	* Support for multiple disks.
	* Support for logging to syslog when running in background.
	* Use autotools.
	* Make the error-messages more user-friendly.
	* -s is optional now. Sensitivity defaults to 15.

hdapsd 20081004:
	Elias Oltmanns <eo@nebensachen.de>:
	* Prepare for the new interface in kernel 2.6.28

hdapsd 20070803:
	Shem Multinymous <multinymous@gmail.com>:
	* Read the accelerometer data from the input device provided by
	  tp_smapi>=0.32, instead of sysfs. This reduce timer interrupts
	  and improves temporal synchronization of user-space<->kernel vs.
	  kernel<->hardware. If the input device doesn't exist, it falls
	  back to sysfs.
	* Add a new new --poll-sysfs (-y) parameter to force using sysfs
	  instead of the input device.
	* Read the sampling rate from the sysfs file provided by tp_smapi
	  (if it exists).
	* Add a --dry-run (-t) parameter, telling hdapsd to do everything
	  except actually parking the drive. Very useful for testing.
