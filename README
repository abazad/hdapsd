hdapsd - Hard Drive Active Protection System Daemon
===================================================

This is a disk protection user-space daemon. It monitors the acceleration
values through the HDAPS/AMS interfaces and automatically initiates disk head
parking if a fall or sliding of the laptop is detected.

1. Compilation
--------------
./configure
make
make install

2. Usage
--------
hdapsd (it will try to autodetect everything itself)
for more options, please read man hdapsd

3. Compatibility
----------------
Since kernel 2.6.28 you don't need to patch your kernel, as support for
IDLE_IMMEDIATE is present in mainline.
 NOTE: The new interface only allows IDLE_IMMEDIATE for drives that
       announce to be ATA-7 conform. But threre are also drives that
       support ATA-6 only but do IDLE_IMMEDIATE fine. For those you
       need to force the interface with:
       echo -1 > /sys/block/$DISK/device/unload_heads
   OR: Call hdapsd like this: hdapsd -f -d $DISK

For kernels <2.6.28, please have a look at
http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/HDAPS#Kernel_patch
and patch your kernel with the appropriate patch before using hdapsd.

4. mainline hdaps module vs tp_smapi
------------------------------------
The mainline hdaps module present in Linux kernels does not support all
hdaps-enabled ThinkPads, thus it is recommended to use the one provided
by tp_smapi.
Additionally the tp_smapi version provides a input interface to the data,
which stops hdapsd from polling the data itself all the time, saving your
battery.
